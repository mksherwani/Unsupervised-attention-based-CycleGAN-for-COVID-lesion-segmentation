Unsupervised attention based CycleGAN for COVID lesion segmentation


This repository is based on the implementation of our submission in Journal of Medical & Biological Engineering & Computing. Through this code we can segment the lesion without any use of annotation. We have tested on Lung COVID-19 CT data but it can be trained on other CT image dataset as well. This implementation is done on Pytorch and all the data used in the research is also provided with this repository. We are still in the phase of uploading the data and the code for repeoducibility. If anyone has any question then kindly reach me to get more details.
